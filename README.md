# Porting Unity game to web platform

## Introduction

This project showcases **how to convert an existing Unity project into a functional web application**, as well as how to deploy it in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so people can access it online without any cost.

The game used in this example can be found [here](https://github.com/LonelyPrincess/mdv-ull-fdv-2d-prototype), although steps to follow would be the same for any other project. If you'd like to get more information on the game itself, refer to the forementioned repository. Current repository contains the outcoming WebGL bundle alone, and focus entirely in the process of porting an existing Unity project to the web platform.
